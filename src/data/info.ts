  about: `From writing my first lines of code to leading engineering teams, my journey in software development has been a continuous path of growth and discovery. Over the past 8 years, I’ve had the privilege to work across diverse roles—Fullstack Engineer, Backend Engineer, Chapter Lead Backend, and Engineering Manager—building applications that solve real problems and scaling systems that impact thousands of users.
What excites me most is not just writing code, but also empowering people. I’ve led backend chapters, guided teams, and even stepped into the public sector for 9 months to contribute to digital transformation in government. Each role has strengthened my ability to balance technical depth with leadership and strategy.
I’m also a proud Google Cloud Professional Developer, always eager to explore new technologies, and I find joy in sharing knowledge—whether through talks, mentoring, or engaging with the IT community. For me, technology is not just about systems, but also about the people who build and grow with it.
