  cvSummary: "Full-Stack Engineer & Tech Leader with 8+ years architecting scalable systems and leading high-performing engineering teams. Backend specialist in Go, Node.js, and PHP with cloud expertise (Google Cloud Certified Professional Developer). Pioneer in AI-augmented development practices and active tech community leader (GDG Bandung Organizer). Proven success in digital transformation, microservices architecture, and delivering solutions for millions of users.",
  about: `Over 8 years, I've learned that great engineering is about **building systems that survive chaos, leading teams that solve hard problems, and making decisions rooted in judgment**. I'm a backend engineer at heart—architecting cloud-native systems in Go, Node.js, and PHP that handle millions of users. I've optimized databases that shaved seconds off response times, designed microservices that let teams move independently, and built APIs that scale. But I'm equally comfortable shipping complete solutions—writing responsive frontends, orchestrating DevOps, ensuring every piece works seamlessly. My foundation is backend depth; my flexibility is full-stack breadth.

In an evolving tech landscape, I practice **AI-augmented development**. I leverage Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini as thinking partners—exploring architecture faster, reviewing code more thoroughly, prototyping ideas in minutes. But I remain the architect. I validate rigorously, question critically, and ship nothing that doesn't meet my standards. It's judgment-first, AI-enhanced—not the other way around.

What excites me most is impact through people and systems. I lead with technical credibility, whether managing engineering teams, establishing standards, or mentoring engineers toward mastery. I've contributed to meaningful missions: scaling systems for millions, driving digital transformation in government, and as an **organizer at GDG Bandung**, cultivating a thriving developer community where engineers **learn new technologies, connect with peers, and grow their careers**. As a **Google Cloud Professional Developer**, I've learned that great technology is built by great teams, not great individuals. I'm drawn to Senior Engineer, Tech Lead, or Engineering Manager roles where **technical depth drives decisions and teams grow alongside technology**.
